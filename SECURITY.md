# Security Policy

We take the security of our repository seriously and appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities. We aim to address all reported security issues promptly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this repository, we encourage you to report it privately. Please **DO NOT** create a public issue on GitHub that contains details of the vulnerability.

### To Report a Vulnerability:

1. **Use GitHub's Built-in Vulnerability Reporting:**  
   You can report vulnerabilities directly via GitHub's [Security Advisory feature](https://github.com/yuga-labs/ape-portal/security/advisories). This will keep the details confidential between the reporter and the repository maintainers.
2. **Provide Detailed Information:**  
   When submitting a report, please include as much information as possible to help us understand the nature of the vulnerability. This includes:

   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any relevant logs, screenshots, or proof-of-concept code
   - Suggested fixes (if applicable)

3. **Response Time:**  
   We strive to respond to vulnerability reports within 72 hours and will provide a timeline for when you can expect a more detailed response or a fix. We greatly appreciate your patience as we work to resolve the issue.

4. **Disclosure and Remediation**
   We ask that you wait until the vulnerability has been remediated and the fix has been implemented up to a reasonable point before disclosing it. Due to the nature of repositories with multiple versions, please be understanding that it can take a few months before users adopt the fix.

Thank you for helping us maintain the security of our project!
